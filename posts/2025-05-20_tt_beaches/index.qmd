My first TidyTuesday data curation!! This is an updated version of the dataset we used for #RYouWithMe, a series of online modules designed to get beginners into #rstats. I am excited to dig in and learn something new about what is going on with poo at Sydney beaches. 

### read the data

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| 
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 20)

water_quality <- tuesdata$water_quality
weather <- tuesdata$weather
```
### to be continued
