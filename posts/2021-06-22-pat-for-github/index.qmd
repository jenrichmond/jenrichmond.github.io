I have been avoiding setting up a Personal Access Token to authenticate my github account for a while because it seemed complicated. Never fear [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html) and `usethis()` to the rescue. 

### create a token

In the RStudio console, install the `usethis` package if you don't already have it and use it to create a github token. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("usethis")

library(usethis)

usethis::create_github_token()
```


This will take you to github and make a token for you. Accept the defaults and copy the token. 

Go back to the RStudio console. Install the `gitcreds` package, if you don't already have it and then use the `gitcreds_set` function to tell R you want to set github credentials. 

### store it in your credentials
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("gitcreds")

library(gitcreds)

gitcreds_set(url = "https://github.com")
```


Then it will ask you to Enter password or token...paste into your console. 


### check that it works

Check that it works, using the `gitcreds_get()` function. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gitcreds_get()

```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("gitcreds.png")
```
