The Tidy Tuesday data today comes from the [`historydata` R package](https://github.com/ropensci/historydata). The today is about US judges. I am particularly interested in the US Supreme Court and how long justices have remained in the role across history. 

# load packages

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(janitor)
library(ggeasy)
library(ggtext)

# adjust year/week values here
year = 2025
week = 23
```

# get the data

Reading the data and dealing with some date formatting. 
```{r get}

tt <- tt_load(year, week)

appt <- tt[[1]]

appt <- appt  %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("_date"), ~ mdy(.))) %>%
  mutate(retirement_from_active_service =  mdy(retirement_from_active_service))

people <- tt[[2]]

people <- people %>%
  mutate(age_at_death = death_date - birth_date)

```


# wrangling

I start by joining the people and appt dataframes and for ease of use, create some new variables that pull year values out of dates. I filter for just the supreme court and select relevant columns, before sorting out some duplicate name issues. 

::: {.callout-note}

Did you know that there were two justices named John Harlan? One born in 1833 and his grandson born in 1899.

:::

I create a new variable that codes dates as pre vs post 1900 and a couple that allow me to set the colour of the dot by a different coloured point depending on whether the justice retired or their term ended (because they died). 

```{r clean}

joined <- left_join(people, appt, by = "judge_id") %>%
  arrange(judge_id) %>%
  mutate(year_confirmed = year(senate_confirmation_date), 
         year_retired = year(retirement_from_active_service), 
         year_terminated = year(termination_date))

ussc <- joined %>%
  filter(court_type == "USSC") %>%
  filter(!is.na(year_confirmed)) %>%
  select(1:6, 26:31) %>%
  mutate(length_of_term = year_terminated - year_confirmed) %>%
  mutate(last_first = paste0(name_last, ", " , name_first)) %>%
  mutate(last_first = case_when(name_last == "Harlan" & birth_date == "1833" ~ "I Harlan, John", 
                                name_last == "Harlan" & birth_date == "1899" ~ "II Harlan, John", 
                                TRUE ~ last_first)) %>%
    distinct(last_first, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(period = case_when(year_confirmed < 1900 ~ "pre1900", 
                             year_confirmed >= 1900 ~ "post1900", 
                            )) %>%
  mutate(endpoint = case_when(!is.na(year_terminated) ~ year_terminated, 
                              !is.na(year_retired) ~ year_retired,  
                               TRUE ~ NA_real_))  %>%                
  mutate(status = case_when(!is.na(year_terminated) ~ "Term end",
                            !is.na(year_retired) ~ "Retired", 
                       TRUE ~ "Current"))

# order names by year confirmed
ussc$last_first <- fct_reorder(ussc$last_first, ussc$year_confirmed) 

# select just plot variables
ussc_plot <- ussc %>%
  select(period, last_first, year_confirmed, year_retired, year_terminated, endpoint, status)

```


# plot

This plot looks ok. It took me ages to work out that the easiest way to make a taller plot that gives each justice more vertical room is to set the r chunk options {r fig.width=6, fig.height=12, fig.dpi=300}. 

Unfortunately this data isn't up to date for the most recent justices. Scalia and Ginsburg have died, Kennedy and Breyer have retired and four new justices have joined the court. 

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=12, fig.dpi=300}

# adding new data for recent appointments

This chunk creates a new dataframe for the four most recent justices and updates values for those that have died and retired.
