This post is my first attempt at a `closeread` scrollytelling story. It tells the story of the [Pūteketeke controversy](https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/resources/bird-century-winner-announced-puteketeke-pandemonium-prevails?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwk43ABhBIEiwAvvMEBxXajWDGGQNmx6QbZjiQlec8hqOLnfd8OZ1hKKLJYBtjSOkwTdUc4RoCbiQQAvD_BwE) that plagued the Forest and Bird NZ *Bird of the Century* competition in 2023.

The `closeread` extension makes it easy to turn a Quarto document into a scrollytelling story like this one. The `closeread` [documentation](https://closeread.dev/) and [this tutorial](https://www.gastonsanchez.com/learn-closeread/) by Gaston Sanchez were helpful in making this story.

This bird is called a Pūteketeke @cr-grebe

::: {#cr-grebe}
![Pūteketeke](img/grebe.jpg)
:::

It is also known as the Australasian Crested Grebe.

There are fewer than 1000 Pūteketeke in New Zealand.

They are known for unique courtship behaviour... @cr-courtship

In my hometown, Wanaka NZ, the humans make the Pūteketeke floating platforms to build their nests on. Read about the [Wanaka Grebe Project here](https://wanakagrebes.org.nz/grebe-project/). @cr-platform

In 2023, the Pūteketeke went global. @cr-bb

Billboards appeared in cities across the world.

How did the Pūteketeke get this kind of international attention??

In 2023 Forest and Bird New Zealand was celebrating its centenary and had dubbed its annual competition "Bird of the Century". @cr-plot1

Each year Forest and Bird invites New Zealanders to vote for their favourite native bird.

In 2023, comedian John Oliver heard about the competition and threw his resources behind a campaign in support of the Pūteketeke. @cr-boty

John Oliver himself described the campaign as ["alarmingly aggressive"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GF6Gd7wrlk) @cr-john

This is not the first time that the Forest and Bird competition has attracted controversy.

In 2021, the Long-tailed bat (Pekapeka-tou-roa) won the Bird of the Year, even though it is definitely not a bird. @cr-bat

:::

The Long-tailed bat (Pekapeka-tou-roa) is New Zealand's only native land mammal and caused a bit of a stir when it was voted as New Zealand's favourite bird in 2021. @cr-plot2

```{r}

The results in 2022 caused less furor.

While the Little Penguin / Kororā technically received the most #1 votes... @cr-penguin

In 2023, @cr-plot4 the result of the John Oliver's campaign was a resounding win for the Pūteketeke (more than 290K votes!) and a boost in donations to Forest and Bird.
