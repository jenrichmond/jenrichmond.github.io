## Learning goal: Make a Shiny app

Inspired by the apps i have seen built around #TidyTuesday data in recent weeks, this week I am going to make an app. I don't know what the data is about yet, which seems risky, but lets give it a go.

Starting with [Getting Started documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/), I have made a new R Project, choosing the Shiny Application option.

This project template has the famous Old Faithful Geyser example embedded, so a working app.R file renders this app when I choose the Run App option from the top tool bar.
