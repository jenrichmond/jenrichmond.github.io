I was curious about how the relative ranking of the US passport over time compared to the passport that is currently the most powerful, that is the Singapore passport. \n\nIt is interesting that over the last ~ 20 years the US passport has gone from Number 1 in the rankings to Number 10, while at the same time the Singapore passport has gone from Number 11 to Number 1. \n\n\n![](featured.png)\n\nEven more interesting is that this shift in rankings is caused by relatively small differences in the number of countries that travellers possessing each passport can visit without obtaining a visa in advance. When plotted in terms of visa-free country access, Singapore has passed the United States in access since 2017, but only by 5-10 countries.\n\n![](visafree.png)\n\n\n# load packages / data\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggeasy)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nyear <- 2025\nweek <- 36\n\ntt <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(year, week)\n\ncountry <- tt[[1]]\n\nrank <- tt[[2]]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# wrangle\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountries <- c(\"United States\", \"Singapore\")\n\nus_sing <- rank %>%\n  filter(country %in% countries) %>%\n  arrange(country, year) %>%\n  filter(visa_free_count > 0)\n\nrank2025 <- rank %>%\n  filter(year == 2025) %>%\n  filter(rank <= 10)\n\npp25 <- as.vector(rank2025$country)\n\ntop10 <- rank %>%\n  filter(country %in% pp25) %>%\n  filter(visa_free_count > 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# plot\n\n### by rank\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npal <- c(\"Singapore\" = \"indianred3\",\"United States\" = \"royalblue3\")\n\np1 <-  us_sing %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rank, colour = country)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = pal) +\n scale_y_reverse(limits = c(11, 1), breaks = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2005, 2025)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  easy_text_size(12) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Passport Rank\", title = \"Passport Power by rank\", \nsubtitle = \"The Henley Passport Index reports the number of countries in which a traveller in possession of that passport can enter without obtaining a visa in advance and passports are commonly ranked on this metric.
