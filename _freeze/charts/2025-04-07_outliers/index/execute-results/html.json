Across the world it is typical for there to be slightly more boys born than girls. The sex ratio at conception is equal but across pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage is slightly higher for female than male fetuses, resulting in an average of 105 male to 100 female live births. But countries like China, India, and South Korea have much higher than average sex ratios. \n\nI am going to reproduce this plot, adding the US, UK and Australia in for comparison. \n\n<iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth?tab=chart&country=CHN~IND~KOR\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;\" allow=\"web-share; clipboard-write\"></iframe>\n\n# load packages\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(owidapi)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggeasy)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(feathers)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### read the data \n\nHere I am reading in the data, cleaning names and renaming variables. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nratio <- read_csv(\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sex-ratio-at-birth.csv?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=true\") %>% \n  clean_names() %>%\n  rename(country = entity, ratio = sex_ratio_sex_all_age_0_variant_estimates)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### clean it up\n\nI am filtering the data to include only China, India, and South Korea, as well as Australia, United States, and United Kingdom for comparison. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountries <- c(\"China\", \"India\", \"South Korea\", \"Australia\", \"United States\", \"United Kingdom\")\n\nratio4 <- ratio %>%\n  filter(country %in% countries)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### plot\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nratio4 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = ratio, colour = country)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBasic plot check!
