I am interested in the results of the [Forest and Bird New Zealand](https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzYLABhD4ARIsALySuCQk3mQLVt-6iWSvTgWhWjh7mhqA8yOavKD3mOuB5AP4TbyKA6IAp0IaAtazEALw_wcB) Bird of the Year competition over the past few years.\n\nOn [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_the_Year) I found tables of the 2022-2024 results but I had to get the 2021 data from the [press release](https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/resources/holy-flying-mammals-batman-bird-year-winner-announced#:~:text=The%20top%20ten%20finishers%20and,10%20Rockhopper%20penguin%20(1603)).\n\nThe [`datapasta` package](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta) from Miles McBain makes copying and pasting data from the wild into RStudio really easy. The cleaning required was a bit unwieldy though, so this [separate .R script](https://github.com/jenrichmond/jenrichmond.github.io/blob/main/charts/2025-04-17_birds/get_bird_data.R) gets the data in for each year, combines it into a single dataframe and fixes all the annoying inconsistencies in bird naming across years, before writing it to csv.\n\n### load packages/read data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(datapasta)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggeasy)\n\ntop10_year <- read_csv(here::here(\"charts\", \"2025-04-17_birds\", \"top10.csv\"))\n\nglimpse(top10_year)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 40\nColumns: 5\n$ bird        <chr> \"Pekapeka-tou-roa / Long-tailed bat\", \"Kākāpō\", \"Titipouna…\n$ votes       <dbl> 2894, 3351, 1852, 1594, 1468, 1228, 1302, 1260, 1184, 1477…\n$ year        <dbl> 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2021…\n$ rank_number <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, …\n$ maori_name  <chr> \"Pekapeka-tou-roa\", \"Kākāpō\", \"Titipounamu\", \"Kea\", \"Toroa…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### plot ranking\n\nThis is rank data so I am trying `ggbump()`again.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ntop10_year %>%\nggplot(aes(year, rank_number, color = maori_name)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n   geom_bump(linewidth = 2, smooth = 8) +\n      scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2019.8, 2025),\n                     breaks = seq(2021, 2024, 1)) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  easy_remove_gridlines()  +\n   geom_text(data = top10_year %>% filter(year == min(year)),\n            aes(x = year - .1, label = maori_name), size = 3.5, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = top10_year %>% filter(year == max(year)),\n            aes(x = year + .1, label = maori_name), size = 3.5, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = seq(1 , 10, 1), limits= c(10,0)) +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 2023, y = 0.5, label = \"Pūteketeke\", size = 1.5),\nmapping = aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),\ncolour = \"#00aafd\", inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 2022, y = 0.5, label = \"Pīwauwau\", size = 1.5),\nmapping = aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),\ncolour = \"#01B7EB\", inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",  y = \"Rank\", title = \"Forest & Bird New Zealand\", subtitle = \"Bird of the Year Ranking: 2021-2024\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Controversy\n\nThe ranking data is interesting but it hides a number of controversies that have plagued the Bird of the year competition in recent years.\n\n#### 2021: not even a bird\n\n![In 2021, the Long-tailed bat (Pekapeka-tou-roa) won the Bird of the Year, despite not being a bird](img/long-tailed-bat-hero-1920.webp){width=\"640\"}\n\nThe Long-tailed bat (Pekapeka-tou-roa) is New Zealand's only native land mammal and [caused a bit of a stir](Te%20Manu%20Rongonui%20o%20te%20Tau) when it was voted as New Zealand's favourite bird in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nd21 <- top10_year %>%\n  filter(year == 2021) %>%\n  mutate(maori_name = fct_reorder(maori_name, rank_number))\n\n\nd21 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rank_number, y = votes, fill = maori_name)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,10, 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,5000)) +\n  labs(y = \"Number #1 Votes\", x = \"Rank\", title = \"Bird of the Year 2021\", subtitle= \"Winner = Pekapeka-tou-roa / Long-tailed bat\",\n       caption = \"note: the BOTY competition uses a single transferable vote system; the bird \\nwith the most Number #1 Votes does not necessarily win\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### 2022: Rock Wren beats the Little Penguin\n\n![In 2022, the NZ Rock Wren beat the Little Penguin](img/rockwren.avif){width=\"640\"}\n\nThe results in 2022 were more typical.
