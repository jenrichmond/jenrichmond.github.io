It tells the story of the [Pūteketeke controversy](https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/resources/bird-century-winner-announced-puteketeke-pandemonium-prevails?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwk43ABhBIEiwAvvMEBxXajWDGGQNmx6QbZjiQlec8hqOLnfd8OZ1hKKLJYBtjSOkwTdUc4RoCbiQQAvD_BwE) that plagued the Forest and Bird NZ *Bird of the Century* competition in 2023.\n\nThe `closeread` extension makes it easy to turn a Quarto document into a scrollytelling story like this one. The `closeread` [documentation](https://closeread.dev/) and [this tutorial](https://www.gastonsanchez.com/learn-closeread/) by Gaston Sanchez were helpful in making this story.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::: cr-section\nThis bird is called a Pūteketeke @cr-grebe\n\n::: {#cr-grebe}\n![Pūteketeke](img/grebe.jpg)\n:::\n\nIt is also known as the Australasian Crested Grebe.\n\nThere are fewer than 1000 Pūteketeke in New Zealand.\n\nThey are known for unique courtship behaviour... @cr-courtship\n\n::: {#cr-courtship}\n![Pūteketeke courtship behaviour](https://media1.tenor.com/m/pr8Ep6wpQoYAAAAd/Pūteketeke-bird.gif)\n:::\n\n... and for being good parents @cr-parenting\n\n::: {#cr-parenting}\n![Pūteketeke parent and chick](https://blog.forestandbird.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/love-you-mum-crested-grebe-steve-attwood.jpg)\n:::\n\nIn my hometown, Wanaka NZ, the humans make the Pūteketeke floating platforms to build their nests on.
