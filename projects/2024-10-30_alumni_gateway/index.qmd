In my work with Psychology students, I led several projects related to career preparation and work integrated learning (WIL).

I led a Student Experience grant that culminated in the [Psychology Alumni gateway](https://alumni.psy.unsw.edu.au/), a site that showcases the diverse career paths that Psychology students pursue following graduation.

The site has interviews with recent alumni explaining how they use their Psychology skills in their chosen career.
