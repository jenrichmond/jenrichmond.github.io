I am a developmental psychologist by training and my research expertise are in learning and memory in early life. My research uses electrophysiology and eye-tracking to ask questions about how infants learn and under what conditions they will remember.

In the last few years, my research has expanded into the Scholarship of Learning and Teaching. I have worked on questions related to student well-being and impact of integrating generative AI into Psychology assessment practices.

In my time in academia, I mentored 6 PhD students and 30 honours students.
