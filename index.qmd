I am a psychologist by training and have been teaching myself (and others) R for a few years now. 

I am one of the founders of R-Ladies Sydney and developer of [#RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/). 

I like to learn new things and write about what I have learned on [my blog](https://jenrichmond.github.io/posts.html). 

I am good at identifying a gap and then make something to fill it. This page showcases some of [my favourite projects](https://jenrichmond.github.io/projects.html).

I LOVE data viz and storytelling; check out [my portfolio](https://jenrichmond.github.io/charts.html).
