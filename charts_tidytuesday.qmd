Tidy Tuesday is a weekly community challenge run by Jon Harmon and team in the Data Science Learning Community. Each week the team post a dataset to their [github page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/README.md) and data enthusiasts from around the world make something with it and share their creations using the #TidyTuesday hashtag. 

I document my TidyTuesday process here, creating useful resources for the community about how my plot came about.
