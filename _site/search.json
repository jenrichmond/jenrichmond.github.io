I add gridlines and with theme(panel.grid.major() and fix the scale on each axis by setting breaks and limits. I colour the points by country here (because the dataset is missing region information) and use easy_remove_legend() from ggeasy to hide the legend.

I didn’t realise that there was an angle option in the Shiny app popup that helps you place your annotation. Here I have used ggannotate to place labels on the geom_abline() lines, and geom_text_repel() to label each point with a country label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is SUPER fiddly to get the x, y position and angle of these labels just right and then… when you render the doc they can look slightly different to the inline output and then… when you export via ggsave they can look slight different again.

I need to filtered the World out to avoid an NA category.\nI want to use the same colours as the OWID plot. The ColorZilla web extension allows you to use a dropper to get the specific # codes for each colour on any plot on the internet- handy!\nI have used scale_colour_manual() to set the colours and added a title and subtitle using labs and removed the legend title using a function from the ggeasy package. I have added some country labels, while trying to avoid overlapping the point using the geom_text_repel() function from the ggrepel package.

    "text": "This plot from Our World in Data illustrates the amount of time that we spend with others and how that changes with age. The slope of line plotting the amount of time that people spend alone is pretty terrifying. Lets see if we can reproduce that plot using ggplot.\n\n\n\nload packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggeasy)\nlibrary(ggannotate)\n\n# remotes::install_github(\"mattcowgill/ggannotate\")\n\n\n\nread in the data\nHere I am reading the data using the owidapi package and selecting and renaming columns within the same line of code. I also want to make the data long so that the category information appears in a single column and the hours values in another.\nI know that colours are often easier to deal with if we turn character variables into factors so that we can set the order. Here I use fct_relevel() to order the categories so that I can easily line up which colour is associated with each.\n\ntime &lt;- read_csv(\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/time-spent-with-relationships-by-age-us.csv?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=true\") %&gt;%\n          clean_names() %&gt;%\nselect(group = entity, age = year, \n         alone = t_who_category_alone, friend = t_who_category_friend, \n         children = t_who_category_children, family = t_who_category_family, \n         partner = t_who_category_partner, coworker = t_who_category_co_worker) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(names_to = \"category\", values_to = \"hours\", alone:coworker)\n\nRows: 201 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Entity\ndbl (7): Year, t__who_category_alone, t__who_category_friend, t__who_categor...\nlgl (1): Code\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ntime$category &lt;- fct_relevel(time$category, c(\"alone\", \"partner\", \"family\", \"children\", \"friend\", \"coworker\"))\n\nlevels(time$category) #check levels\n\n[1] \"alone\"    \"partner\"  \"family\"   \"children\" \"friend\"   \"coworker\"\n\nglimpse(time)\n\nRows: 1,206\nColumns: 4\n$ group    &lt;chr&gt; \"All people\", \"All people\", \"All people\", \"All people\", \"All …\n$ age      &lt;dbl&gt; 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 17, 17, 17, 1…\n$ category &lt;fct&gt; alone, friend, children, family, partner, coworker, alone, fr…\n$ hours    &lt;dbl&gt; 3.629829200, 1.584973700, 0.363883400, 4.324233500, 0.0000000…\n\n\n\n\nmake basic plot\nThe dataset contains time use data for Male and Female separate, but lets start with a plot of All people.\n\ntime %&gt;%\n  filter(group == \"All people\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = hours, colour = category)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic plot… check! Here is a list of things I would like to change…\n\ntheme and colours\nadd horizontal gridlines\nfilter out data point more than 80\nstart x axis at 15, 30 then in increments of 10\ny axis add h to numbers\nadd group annotations rather than legend\n\n\n\ntheme and colours\nI started by filtering out data with age values greater than 80. I used the ColorZilla web extension to get the # codes for the colours in the Our World in Data plot and scale_colour_manual() to set the colours.\nI fixed the y axis using scale_y_continuous() breaks and got most of the way there with theme_minimal(). The easy_remove_gridlines() function from ggeasy makes it easy to control which gridlines you want to display. Here I want to remove both major and minor verticial lines but keep the major horizontal lines. I want the gridlines to be dotted and use the theme(panel.grid = element_line() to achieve that.\n\ntime %&gt;%\n  filter(age &lt; 80) %&gt;%\n  filter(group == \"All people\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = hours, colour = category)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#496899\", \"#6b3d8d\", \"#2b8465\", \"#986d39\", \"#b03508\", \"#883039\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), breaks = seq(0,8,1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"x\", major = TRUE, minor = TRUE) +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"y\", major = FALSE, minor = TRUE) +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(linewidth = 0.4, linetype = 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naxes\nNow theme_minimal() removes the x and y axis lines and ticks. I want to add the line/ticks back in on just the x axis so use theme(axis.line.x = element_line()and theme(axis.ticks.x = element_line().\n\ntime %&gt;%\n  filter(age &lt; 80) %&gt;%\n  filter(group == \"All people\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = hours, colour = category)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#496899\", \"#6b3d8d\", \"#2b8465\", \"#986d39\", \"#b03508\", \"#883039\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(-0.05,8.1), breaks = seq(0,9,1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(15,30,40,50,60,70,80)) +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"x\") +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"y\", major = FALSE, minor = TRUE) +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(linewidth = 0.4, linetype = 2)) +\n  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"darkgrey\", linetype=1), \n        axis.ticks.x = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, color=\"darkgrey\")\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nannotations\nThe easy_remove_legend() function from the ggeasy package makes it easy to get rid of a legend; getting annotations on the end of the each line is a bit tricker. I’m sure there is a simpler way, but the ggannotate package by Matt Cowgill pulls up a shiny panel that allows you to place annotations where you want them and then copy the geom_text() code into your chunk.\n\n  time %&gt;%\n  filter(age &lt; 80) %&gt;%\n  filter(group == \"All people\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = hours, colour = category)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#496899\", \"#6b3d8d\", \"#2b8465\", \"#986d39\", \"#b03508\", \"#883039\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(-0.05,8.1), breaks = seq(0,9,1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(15,30,40,50,60,70,80)) +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"x\") +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"y\", major = FALSE, minor = TRUE) +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(linewidth = 0.4, linetype = 2)) +\n  theme(axis.ticks.x =   element_line(linewidth = 0.5, color=\"darkgrey\") , \n        axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"darkgrey\", linetype=1)) +\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 82, y = 8, \n    label = \"Alone\"), aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 3, colour = \"#496899\") +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 82, y = 4.4, \n    label = \"With \\npartner\"), aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 3,colour = \"#6b3d8d\") +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 80, y = 1.3, \n    label = \"With family\"),aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 3, colour = \"#2b8465\") +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 83.5, y = 0.7, \n    label = \"With children\"), aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 2.5,colour = \"#986d39\") +\n geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 83.5, y = 0.5, \n    label = \"With friends\"), aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 2.5,colour = \"#b03508\") +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 83.5, y = 0.1, \n    label = \"With coworkers\"), aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 2.5, colour = \"#883039\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitles and captions\nFinishing touches… title, subtitle and caption.
