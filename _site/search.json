They always make really interesting plots out of all kinds of different data, but they use an in-house data viz platform called “Grapher” so it isn’t easy to find code that can be used to reproduce the charts.\nMy goal in April is use the 30 day chart challenge prompt to find a Our World in Data plot that looks interesting, and then to try to reproduce the plot using ggplot code.\nI will post the final code for each plot in a tabset below, but if you want to see how each chart came about (i.e. my troubleshooting process), there will be a blog post associated with each one.\nThe owidapi package is an easy way to get access to the data sources that the Our World in Data site uses.\nlibrary(owidapi)\n\ncatalog &lt;- owid_get_catalog()\n\nwillingness &lt;- owid_get(\"willingness-climate-action\")"

I used the ColorZilla web extension to get the # codes for the colours in the Our World in Data plot and scale_colour_manual() to set the colours.\nI fixed the y axis using scale_y_continuous() breaks and got most of the way there with theme_minimal(). The easy_remove_gridlines() function from ggeasy makes it easy to control which gridlines you want to display. Here I want to remove both major and minor verticial lines but keep the major horizontal lines. I want the gridlines to be dotted and use the theme(panel.grid = element_line() to achieve that.\n\ntime %&gt;%\n  filter(age &lt; 80) %&gt;%\n  filter(group == \"All people\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = hours, colour = category)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"#496899\", \"#6b3d8d\", \"#2b8465\", \"#986d39\", \"#b03508\", \"#883039\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), breaks = seq(0,8,1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"x\", major = TRUE, minor = TRUE) +\n  easy_remove_gridlines(axis = \"y\", major = FALSE, minor = TRUE) +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(linewidth = 0.4, linetype = 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naxes\nNow theme_minimal() removes the x and y axis lines and ticks.

Oceania is not doing well; the majority of countries have less than 10% of government seats held by women. This dataset only includes the number of countries in each region that have women represented in each of the percent categories. This includes 6 Oceanic countries, but it doesn’t include information about which 6 countries are included. I am interested to dig into the country level data here.\nI was also surprised that Asia is the only region that still has 2 countries that have no women in government. Again, I am curious about which 2; Afghanistan maybe? Perhaps there are Middle East countries that do not have women in government."

Oceania is not doing well; the majority of countries have less than 10% of government seats held by women. This dataset only includes the number of countries in each region that have women represented in each of the percent categories. This includes 6 Oceanic countries, but it doesn’t include information about which 6 countries are included. I am interested to dig into the country level data here.\nI was also surprised that Asia is the only region that still has 2 countries that have no women in government. Again, I am curious about which 2; Afghanistan maybe? Perhaps there are Middle East countries that do not have women in government."

    "text": "Exploring OurWorldinData this morning looking for plots that might fit the negative theme for today and this article caught my eye.\nApparently we vastly underestimate how happy other people are. Much like my Day 1 plot re climate action, when asked how happy they are and how happy they think other people in their country are, we judge others negatively, rating them to be much less happy than we are ourselves.\nSadly I couldn’t find the data from that plot to reproduce it, but in exploring the IPSOS website, I found this article about what worries the world in March 2025. The data was downloadable and I think probably better represented as stacked bars rather than pie charts, so that is my challenge for today."

    "text": "One of my goals while on long service leave is to learn some new R things that have been on my radar for a while… the first of these is purrr. The purrr package allows you to iterate a function across different elements in a list or dataframe.\nI have started to try and learn purr before (see a list of resources here). I have copied other people’s purrr code a couple of times too…\n\nhow to use map to read in a LOT of .csv files and\nusing pwalk to output plots in different colour schemes\n\n… but when you copy purrr code from someone else and adjust it to suit you own problem… you can’t really say you know how to use purrr.\nThe first thing I think I need to get my head around in order to understand purrr is lists. Dataframes are the bread and butter of the tidyverse and up until now I have avoided them, or tried desperately to use as.dataframe() or unnest() to turn them into a data structure that i understand. Lists allow you to bundle together different kinds of data elements together, so now is the time to get my head around them.\n\nhow to make a list\nThis is a example I copied from a tutorial\nmyfirstlist &lt;-  list(2, \n                     \"hello\", \n                     c(3,5,4), \n                     1:5, \n                     list(FALSE, \n                          c(\"this\", \"is\",\"a\",\"list\"),\n                          c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE))) \nThe list() function lets you put elements of all different types (and lengths) into a listy bundle; characters and numbers and logicals. One of the elements in this list of 5 items when others have 3 items or even 1. Another item is ANOTHER list made up of 3 items. Lists within lists— eeeekk. We can use the class() function to check that our list is a list and the str() function to get our head around what we are dealing with.\nclass(myfirstlist)\n## [1] \"list\"\nstr(myfirstlist)\n## List of 5\n##  $ : num 2\n##  $ : chr \"hello\"\n##  $ : num [1:3] 3 5 4\n##  $ : int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n##  $ :List of 3\n##   ..$ : logi FALSE\n##   ..$ : chr [1:4] \"this\" \"is\" \"a\" \"list\"\n##   ..$ : logi [1:5] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE\nThis iconic image (which I think comes from a Jenny Bryan talk) is supposed to help me understand how to access elements of a list.\nLets see if I can unpack it.\n TBC…"

But the terminal in RStudio has been giving me this hint for a while and I have been ignoring it.\n\nI think this hint is trying to help me but I don’t know what rebase or fast-forward means… to google…\nThis post suggests that I should only use git pull -ff, going as far as setting -ff as a global config setting.\nApparently git pull is actually a two step thing (git fetch + git merge). First, it fetches the content from the remote and then it merges that content into your local. That is USUALLY fine… especially if you are working alone and nothing has changed about your remote repo since the last time you pulled. In this case, your local will be ahead of your remote and git pull will be fine.\nBut if you are using git to collaborate and your team member has pushed some changes to the files you are working on, you can find yourself with a merge conflict.\nThe git pull –ff-only command will fetch and merge content from the remote repo, only if it can be done be done by “fast-fowarding”- that is, without creating new commits. This will only happen if the remote and local haven’t diverged. If they have it will give you a warning.\nMy Twitter friends think that in my use case, when I am mostly working with myself and the remote is unlikely to have diverged from the local, the default option will work fine.\nYay for #rstats twitter!\n\n\nAnyone #rstats know of a helpful rebase vs. fastforward explainer? Which of these options I should choose? My use case is simpler than most.

Our immediate question was “how to you know what the names of the colours that R knows are?”\nThis is a “I don’t have to google” post about finding the colours that R knows about.\n\nread the data\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ntrees &lt;-read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiirsti/ggplot_adventcalendaR/main/xmas.trees.csv\")\n\n\n\nmake a plot\n\ntrees %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x=type, y=height))+\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=type), colour=\"black\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"darkgreen\", \"firebrick2\", \"mediumseagreen\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can have R list the names of all the colours it knows (there are 657 of them) using the colours() function, but that is not so useful if you want to see the difference between aquamarine1 and aquamarine2.\n\n# list the first 20 colours that R knows \n\nhead(colours(), 20)\n\n [1] \"white\"         \"aliceblue\"     \"antiquewhite\"  \"antiquewhite1\"\n [5] \"antiquewhite2\" \"antiquewhite3\" \"antiquewhite4\" \"aquamarine\"   \n [9] \"aquamarine1\"   \"aquamarine2\"   \"aquamarine3\"   \"aquamarine4\"  \n[13] \"azure\"         \"azure1\"        \"azure2\"        \"azure3\"       \n[17] \"azure4\"        \"beige\"         \"bisque\"        \"bisque1\"      \n\n\nWe eventually found a function in the epitools package that will display all the colours and allow you to point a click the ones you want! It doesn’t work so well in an Rmd chunk- you are best to try it in the console.\n\n# install.packages(\"epitools\")\n\nlibrary(epitools)\n\ncolors.plot(locator = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] color.names\n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\nLoad the epitools package and then use the colors.plot() function in the console, setting locator = TRUE. A matrix will appear in your Plots tab. You can use your mouse to pick the colours you want and then click Finish to have R print the names of those colours to your console. Watch me do it in the screencast below.\n\n\nYou can then use those names to revise your plot colours.\n\ntrees %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x=type, y=height))+\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=type), colour=\"black\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"seagreen\", \"maroon2\", \"dodgerblue2\"))"

A dictionary that helps me link functions I know in R to new functions I am learning in Python could be handy.\nLinking new concepts to old concepts is also a useful learning strategy. Research in Psychology tells us that memory is relational; the brain represents memories as networks of representations. If you can link something that you are trying to learn to something you already know, you are much more likely to remember that new thing into the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\nArt credit: China Blue Art, Memory Network I\n\n\n\n\nOf course, there are probably a million R to Python dictionaries on the internet; why am I creating a new one for me?\nThat’s because we also know that generative learning and retrieval practice are more effective strategies for remembering things into the long term, than are learning strategies that involve passive review of materials that were created by someone else.\nTo create a dictionary of functions as I learn new things in Python, I need to retrieve the equivalent function in R from memory and actively evaluate the similarities and differences between the Python and R versions. That process of retrieving and using the concepts I already know, strengthens both my knowledge of R, and links my new Python understanding to it.\nSo I am starting a googlesheet to keep track of new things I am learning how to do in Python and their R equivalents. Maybe I can read that googlesheet in here using the googlesheets4 package and make it display in a searchable table using gt.\n\ncheat_sheet %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\"My R vs Python cheatsheet\") %&gt;%\n  opt_interactive(use_search = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nMy R vs Python cheatsheet"

But janitor package includes lots of other useful functions that make it easier to deal with dirty data and count stuff.\n\nExploring package functions\nAre you keen to dig into the little known functions of a package that you use all the time? Here is a tip: in console type the name of the package with a double colon (i.e. janitor::), all the functions in the package will pop up and you can explore them by scrolling up and down the list.\nAlternatively you can load the package in the console and then use ls(package:packagename) to get a list of all the objects in the package.\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nls(package:janitor)\n\n [1] \"%&gt;%\"                   \"add_totals_col\"        \"add_totals_row\"       \n [4] \"adorn_crosstab\"        \"adorn_ns\"              \"adorn_pct_formatting\" \n [7] \"adorn_percentages\"     \"adorn_rounding\"        \"adorn_title\"          \n[10] \"adorn_totals\"          \"as_tabyl\"              \"chisq.test\"           \n[13] \"clean_names\"           \"compare_df_cols\"       \"compare_df_cols_same\" \n[16] \"convert_to_date\"       \"convert_to_datetime\"   \"convert_to_NA\"        \n[19] \"crosstab\"              \"describe_class\"        \"excel_numeric_to_date\"\n[22] \"find_header\"           \"fisher.test\"           \"get_dupes\"            \n[25] \"get_one_to_one\"        \"make_clean_names\"      \"remove_constant\"      \n[28] \"remove_empty\"          \"remove_empty_cols\"     \"remove_empty_rows\"    \n[31] \"round_half_up\"         \"round_to_fraction\"     \"row_to_names\"         \n[34] \"sas_numeric_to_date\"   \"signif_half_up\"        \"single_value\"         \n[37] \"tabyl\"                 \"top_levels\"            \"untabyl\"              \n[40] \"use_first_valid_of\"   \n\n\nLets try a few these functions.\n\n\nread some dirty data\nThe penguin data isn’t very dirty out of the package, but I added some funky things for illustrative purposes.\n\ndirty &lt;- read_csv(\"penguin_raw_dirty.csv\")\n\n\n\n1. clean_names()\nThe penguin variable names are not great.

I add gridlines and with theme(panel.grid.major() and fix the scale on each axis by setting breaks and limits.

The theme today is ranking, so I wonder whether I can look at where the USA ranks relative to other countries on these metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nread in the data\nHere I am reading the data and renaming variables.

The manu package has lovely palettes inspired by New Zealand birds.\nI need one palette that has 8 colours for the spend plot and another that has 6 colours for the people plot. I decided to use the 6 colour kereru palette for the people plot and to add a couple of those colours to the takehe palette (plus an extra blue), to make up the 8 colours needed for the spend plot.\nTo ensure that the order of the countries / colours lined up, I made country a factor and checked that the levels of that factor matched the palette.\n\ntop5spend$country &lt;- as.factor(top5spend$country)\n\nlevels(top5spend$country)\n\n[1] \"Belgium\"       \"Germany\"       \"Israel\"        \"Japan\"        \n[5] \"South Korea\"   \"Sweden\"        \"Switzerland\"   \"United States\"\n\npalette_takehe_plus &lt;- c(\"#DD3C51\", \"#313657\", \"#1F6683\", \"#6C90B9\", \"#4d5f8e\",\"#A092B7\",\"#D1C7B5\", \"#85BEDC\")\n\n\ntop5people$country &lt;- as.factor(top5people$country)\n\nlevels(top5people$country)\n\n[1] \"Denmark\"     \"Finland\"     \"Norway\"      \"Singapore\"   \"South Korea\"\n[6] \"Sweden\"     \n\npalette_kereru &lt;- c(\"#325756\", \"#7d9fc2\", \"#C582B2\", \"#51806a\", \"#4d5f8e\", \"#A092B7\")\n\n\ns &lt;- top5spend %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(year, rank, color = country)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n   geom_bump(size = 2, smooth = 8) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = palette_takehe_plus) +\n  geom_text(data = top5spend %&gt;% filter(year == min(year)),\n            aes(x = year - .1, label = country), size = 3.5, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = top5spend %&gt;% filter(year == max(year)),\n            aes(x = year + .1, label = country), size = 3.5, hjust = 0) +\n    scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2017.6, 2021.5),\n                     breaks = seq(2018, 2021, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  easy_remove_gridlines() +\n  labs(title = \"R&D spending percent of GDP: Top 5 countries\", \n       subtitle = \"includes basic research, applied research, and experimental development\", \n       y = \"Ranking\", x = \"Year\") +\n  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 2019, y = 4.7, label = \"Switzerland\"),\nmapping = aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),\nsize = 3.7, colour = \"#D1C7B5\", inherit.aes = FALSE)\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- top5people %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(year, rank, color = country)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n   geom_bump(size = 2, smooth = 8) +\n   scale_colour_manual(values = palette_kereru) +\n  geom_text(data = top5people %&gt;% filter(year == min(year)),\n            aes(x = year - .1, label = country), size = 3.5, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = top5people %&gt;% filter(year == max(year)),\n            aes(x = year + .1, label = country), size = 3.5, hjust = 0) +\n    scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2017.6, 2021.5),\n                     breaks = seq(2018, 2021, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  easy_remove_gridlines() +\n  labs(title = \"R&D researchers per million people: Top 5 countries\", \n       subtitle = \"Professionals conceiving or creating new knowledge, products, processes, methods, or systems\", \n       y = \"Ranking\", x = \"Year\") \n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork\nThe patchwork package makes it super easy to combine different ggplots into a single output.

Using the layout = “fixed” option allow a side by side comparison of the HepB and HepC plots\n\nhepB &lt;- hep %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(area = new_hepB, fill = WHO_region, layout = \"fixed\",\n             label = paste(WHO_region, new_hepB, sep = \"\\n\"))) +\n  geom_treemap(colour = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_treemap_text(colour = \"black\",\n                    place = \"topleft\",\n                    size = 5, \n                    grow = FALSE) + # option from ggfittext to NOT make font fit box\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  labs(title = \"Figure 2.4 Number of new hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, by WHO region, 2022\", subtitle = \"Hepatitis B\") +\n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 5), \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) \n\n\n\n hepC &lt;- hep %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(area = new_hepC, fill = WHO_region, layout = \"fixed\",\n             label = paste(WHO_region, new_hepC, sep = \"\\n\"))) +\n  geom_treemap(colour = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_treemap_text(colour = \"black\",\n                    place = \"topleft\",\n                    size = 5, \n                    grow = FALSE) + # option from ggfittext to NOT make font fit box\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Hepatitis C\") +\n   theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 5))\n\n \n hepB  + hepC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, claude helped get the yellow/bold formatting for the title. The ggtext package is required to allow for element_markdown()\n\nhepB &lt;- hep %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(area = new_hepB, fill = WHO_region, layout = \"fixed\",\n             label = paste(WHO_region, new_hepB, sep = \"\\n\"))) +\n  geom_treemap(colour = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_treemap_text(colour = \"black\",\n                    place = \"topleft\",\n                    size = 5, \n                    grow = FALSE) + # option from ggfittext to NOT make font fit box\n  easy_remove_legend() +\nlabs(title = \"&lt;span style='color:#F4BD4B;'&gt;Figure 2.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Number of new hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, by WHO region, 2022&lt;/span&gt;\", \n     subtitle = \"Hepatitis B\") +\n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 5), \n        plot.title = element_markdown(hjust = 0, size = 8, face = \"bold\"))\n\n hepC &lt;- hep %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(area = new_hepC, fill = WHO_region, layout = \"fixed\",\n             label = paste(WHO_region, new_hepC, sep = \"\\n\"))) +\n  geom_treemap(colour = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_treemap_text(colour = \"black\",\n                    place = \"topleft\",\n                    size = 5, \n                    grow = FALSE) + # option from ggfittext to NOT make font fit box\n  easy_remove_legend() +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Hepatitis C\") +\n   theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 5))\n\n \n hepB  + hepC"
