I am a developmental psychologist by training and have been teaching myself (and others) R for a few years now. I am a co-founder of R-Ladies Sydney and developer of [#RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/). This is my place to keep notes about R (and python) things I am learning. This site makes my googling faster! I hope it is useful to you too.
