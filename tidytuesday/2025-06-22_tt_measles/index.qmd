Super quick post today, mostly just a link to the Shiny dashboard I made with this week's Tidy Tuesday data, which comes from provisional WHO data about measles and rubella cases worldwide.

I made the app with LOTS of help from Claude. I do not know Shiny, but it turns out with some help, I can DO Shiny :)


The code for my app code is available on [github](https://github.com/jenrichmond/shinymeasles).

The app is deployed (for free) via Posit connect cloud.
