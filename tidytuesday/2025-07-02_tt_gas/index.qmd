The TidyTuesday data this week are about gasoline and diesel prices in the US. I have plotted the price differential between regular gasoline and diesel.

tt <-  tt_load(2025, week = 26)

gas <- tt$weekly_gas_prices


```

# wrangle

```{r}
g <- gas %>%
  filter(
    fuel == "diesel" & grade == "all" |
    (fuel == "gasoline" & grade == "regular" & formulation == "all")) %>%

  filter(date >= "1994-03-21") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  mutate(
    diff = price[fuel == "diesel"] - price[fuel == "gasoline"]
  ) %>%
  ungroup()


```
