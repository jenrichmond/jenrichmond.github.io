The TidyTuesday data this week are about gasoline and diesel prices in the US. I have plotted the price differential between regular gasoline and diesel.

# get data

tt <-  tt_load(2025, week = 26)

gas <- tt$weekly_gas_prices


```

# wrangle

I want to get the difference between diesel and gasoline prices and my first instinct is to make the data wide and when subtract across columns. Here I worked out how to get difference scores without making the data wide first.

### group_by |> mutate


```{r}
#| code-fold: false
g_long <- gas %>%
  filter(
    fuel == "diesel" & grade == "all" |
    (fuel == "gasoline" & grade == "regular" & formulation == "all")) %>%
  select(date, fuel, price) %>%
  filter(date >= "1994-03-21") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  mutate(diff = price[fuel == "diesel"] - price[fuel == "gasoline"]) %>%
  ungroup()


```

### pivot_wider |> rowwise |> mutate


```{r}
#| code-fold: false
g_wide <- gas %>%
  filter(
    fuel == "diesel" & grade == "all" |
    (fuel == "gasoline" & grade == "regular" & formulation == "all")) %>%
  select(date, fuel, price) %>%
  filter(date >= "1994-03-21") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = fuel, values_from = price) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(diff = diesel - gasoline) %>%
  ungroup()


```
