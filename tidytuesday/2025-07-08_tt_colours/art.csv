NYCT,Grand Central-42 St,"S,4,5,6,7",Dan Sinclair,Fast Track and Speedwheels,1990,"Stainless steel, copper and brass","Dan SinclairÕs Fast Track and Speedwheels are exuberant assemblages of metal parts including wavy aluminum sheets, steel wheels, brass disks, and copper springs and wires.  They are meant to look strangely at home at the ends of the long underground passage at Grand Central, to Òseem to have grown on the site, Ó observed the March 25, 1991, New Yorker.  Curious riders are invited to make associations and to read varied meanings into the metal collages.  Among other things, they might suggest antiquated machinery, old photograph records, or birds in flight.  ÒI want my sculpture to make people think of the power of the engines that drive the trains, the speed and efficiency of them . . . the sculptures also reflect the architectural elements of Times Square and the Art Deco glamour of Radio City Music Hall,Ó says the artist.  Or as the writer of the New Yorker piece observed, ÒThey remind me of what a hankie would look like if you fluttered it out of a subway-car window.Ó",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/fast-track-speedwheels
NYCT,Grand Central-42 St,"7,4,5,6,S",Christopher Sproat,V-Beam,2000,"Lighting elements, Stainless steel","V-Beam is both a functional structure and an aesthetic statement.  In the piece, artist Christopher Sproat has combined standard utilitarian transportation hardware Ð signage, air circulation, and safety equipment Ð and his own artistic skill and imagination to integrate sculpture into the transit environment.  The artwork takes the form of a large V, which Sproat judged to be the most practical shape in terms of access and stability, and is equipped with extruded aluminum panels and light-emitting diodes to carry out its functions.   ÒRather than make an artistic or decorative statement and add it to the station so that the viewer knows Ô this is art,Õ I chose to make the entire space exuberant and unique,Ó the artist says.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/v-beam
NYCT,Grand Central-42 St,"S,4,5,6,7",Jackie Ferrara,"Grand Central: Arches, Towers, Pyramids",2020,Ceramic mosaic,"The passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central's subway stations are like a bustling city, an underground community Ñ but without a skyline. This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. 

As part of the 2020 upgrades to the 42 St Shuttle, Jackie FerraraÕs ÒGrand Central: Arches, Towers, PyramidsÓ (2000) was expanded to span the new six-car length of track 4 and wrap new stairs from the mezzanine. The project was originally conceived as a skyline for the underground passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central Terminal. Rendered as an expansive mosaic band more than 1,500 feet long, the artwork brings architectural views down below into the busting station. Original artwork and expansion were fabricated by COLORCO Ltd. 

Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, and almost primitive-looking structures. Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same. Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle. The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers. Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: ""This sequence of stripe/image is calculated. It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train.""",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/grand-central-arches-towers-pyramids
NYCT,Grand Central-42 St,"4,5,6,S",Jim Hodges,I dreamed a world and called it Love,2020,Mirrored glass,"Jim Hodges' mirrored-glass artwork ""I dreamed a world and called it Love"" is nestled above the busiest entrance at Grand Central-42 St. Reflections of riders are a constant but ever-changing element of this public installation. No two visits will ever be the same.

The expansive work is located near the 42 Street entrance on the landing and mezzanine levels of the stairs and escalator that connect Grand Central Terminal with the subway station. It's composed of over 5,000 pieces of glass in more than 70 different colors. The composition inverts the commuterÕs visual experience of descending underground. The progression begins with an upper landing rendered in sparkling deep blues that reference the celestial ceiling of Grand Central TerminalÕs Main Concourse and contrast the pale stone architecture of the terminal. It then bursts into a kaleidoscope of color on the lower mezzanine, dazzling against the backdrop of black granite in the renovated subway entrance.

Camouflage serves as a representation of nature. The artwork's organic patterning contains a sense of life. Shapes appear fluid and imbue the surface with a swirling visual dynamism that mimics the pulsating energy of the station itself.",https://new.mta.info/agency/arts-design/collection/i-dreamed-a-world-and-called-it-love
