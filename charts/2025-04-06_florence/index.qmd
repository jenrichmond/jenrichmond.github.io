[This plot](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/willingness-climate-action) from Our World in Data illustrates the proportion of people who are willing to donate 1% of their income to climate change as a function of people's estimate of how many people in their country would be willing to do that. As it turns out, people have a rather dim view of the likelihood that others would commit to supporting climate action.
