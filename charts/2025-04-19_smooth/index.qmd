[Egg prices in the USA](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/dozen-egg-prices-drop-charts-data-rcna200232) are high right now, mostly due to supply issues caused by bird flu outbreaks. I was interested in how prices compare to egg prices in NZ, which have been high since [battery farms bans wwent into effect](https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/how-did-egg-prices-double-in-a-year?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwk43ABhBIEiwAvvMEB5SiHsth08IkoYuGeXo6df4B5r6xlNonBhDxZqLCd3tOpbE9P0JmFBoCxCoQAvD_BwE) in 2022. 

The data for these plot came from StatsNZ and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and reuested a bit of wrangling to make the format consistent. You can find the code that I wrong to read in and clean the egg data in this [.R script](https://github.com/jenrichmond/jenrichmond.github.io/blob/main/charts/2025-04-19_smooth/get%20egg%20data.R) 

## read data/fix dates

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

eggs <- read_csv(here("charts", "2025-04-19_smooth", "eggsNZUSA.csv")) 


eggs <- eggs %>%
    mutate(month_year = paste0(month, "_", year)) %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::my(month_year))

glimpse(eggs)
  
```


# plot

The Quarto panel tabset is a nice way of comparing different plot options here. I think the smooth option looks better with slightly transparent points.
