For the Day 25 prompt risk, I am going to try my hand at maps and reproduce the [CDC plots](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_7-mmr-vaccine-coverage-for-kindergarteners-by-school-year-2009%e2%80%932024) relating to measles vaccination and cases in the US. 



```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(usmap)
library(janitor)

vax <- read_csv(here("charts/2025-04-25_risk/kindy_vax _rates.csv")) %>%
  mutate(year = str_sub(school_year, 1,4)) %>%
  select(state = geography, year, estimate_pct, categories) %>%
  mutate(estimate_pct = parse_number(estimate_pct)) 

cases2425 <- read_csv(here("charts/2025-04-25_risk/cases20242025.csv")) %>%
  select(state = geography, year, cases_calendar_year)

vax$year <- as.numeric(vax$year)

glimpse(vax)

```

# vaccination rates

It looks like there is data for the school year going back to 2009- maybe that would be cool to animate later but for the moment I am interested in the most recent school year. 

```{r}

vax2324 <- vax %>%
  filter(year == "2023") 

```

The dataset has vax rates as both percent estimate and categories. First I am going to try colouring by the numeric percent values. I would like the lowest to show up red. 

```{r}
min(vax2324$estimate_pct)
max(vax2324$estimate_pct)


plot_usmap(data = vax2324, values = "estimate_pct", labels=FALSE) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "red", high = "white", 
                         name = "percent", 
                        limits = c(75,100)) +
  labs(title = "Percent of kindergarten children vaccinated for measles by state", 
       subtitle = "School year 2023-24")



```

What would it look like if we used the categories instead? 

```{r}

vax2324$categories <- fct_relevel(vax2324$categories, c("95%+", "90-94.9%", "Less than 90%"))

levels(vax2324$categories)


plot_usmap(data = vax2324, values = "categories", labels=FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ffcccc", "#ff7380", "#ff1933"))  +
   labs(title = "Percent of kindergarten children vaccinated for measles by state", 
       subtitle = "School year 2023-24") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom")

```



### measles cases


```{r}
plot_usmap(data = cases2425, values = "cases_calendar_year", labels=FALSE) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "red", 
                         name = "cases", 
                        limits = c(0,600)) +
  labs(title = "USA Measles cases by state", subtitle = "Data as of April 17, 2025", caption = "Data from CDC \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html") +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(color = "black", size = 10)
  )
```

```{r}
#| include: false

ggsave(here::here("charts", "2025-03-31_challenge", "measles.png"), width = 6, height = 4,  bg = "white")


ggsave("featured.png",  width = 6, height = 4,  bg = "white")
```
