I have some time on my hands at the moment and thought the #30DayChartChallenge might be a good way to refresh my ggplot skills.

![](featured.png)

The [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) is a fun place to explore data visualisations. They always make really interesting plots out of all kinds of different data, but they use an in-house data viz platform called "Grapher" so it isn't easy to find code that can be used to reproduce the charts.

My goal in April is use the 30 day chart challenge prompt to find a [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) plot that looks interesting, and then to try to reproduce the plot using `ggplot` code.

I will post the final code for each plot in a tabset below, but if you want to see how each chart came about (i.e. my troubleshooting process), there will be a blog post associated with each one.

The `owidapi` package is an easy way to get access to the data sources that the Our World in Data site uses.

-   Load the package and then use the `owid_get_catalog()` function to get a dataframe of all the different plots that have been made.
-   Find one on the site that fits the 30 Day Chart Challenge prompt and then find the slug in your catalog dataframe and use that with the `owid_get` to read the data from the API.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| 

library(owidapi)

catalog <- owid_get_catalog()

willingness <- owid_get("willingness-climate-action") 

```
